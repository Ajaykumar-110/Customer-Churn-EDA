#  Customer Churn Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges faced by subscription-based and service-oriented businesses. This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a customer churn dataset to understand **why customers leave**, identify key influencing factors, and extract meaningful business insights.

The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior using Python and visualize patterns that help organizations improve **customer retention strategies**.

## Objectives

 Understand the structure and quality of the dataset
 Identify important features related to customer churn
 Perform univariate and bivariate analysis
 Visualize trends and patterns using graphs
 Extract actionable business insights

## Tools & Libraries Used

**NumPy** – numerical computations
**Pandas** – data cleaning and manipulation
**Matplotlib** – basic data visualization
**Seaborn** – advanced and statistical visualization

## Dataset Information

  The dataset contains customer demographic, service usage, and billing details
  Target variable: Churn (Yes / No)
  Includes features such as:

    Tenure
    Monthly Charges
    Contract Type
    Payment Method
    Internet & Phone Services

## EDA Process

1. Data loading and understanding
2. Handling missing and inconsistent values
3. Data type conversion
4. Univariate analysis (single variable analysis)
5. Bivariate analysis (relationship between variables)
6. Correlation analysis
7. Visualization and interpretation

## Key Insights

Customers with month-to-month contracts have a higher churn rate
Higher monthly charges are associated with increased churn
Customers with longer tenure are more likely to stay
Certain payment methods show higher churn behavior

##  Visualizations Included

 Bar charts for categorical analysis
 Histograms and KDE plots for distributions
 Box plots to detect outliers
 Heatmap for correlation analysis

## Conclusion

This EDA project highlights how customer behavior and service-related factors influence churn. The insights gained can help businesses design better pricing, contract strategies, and customer engagement plans to reduce churn.
